Some examples for how to create an animated typing text effect in Godot.

# Append
The default script TypingLabelAppend.gd will add one character at a time to the label. This gives a "natural" typing effect. When auto-wrap is enabled words will jump between lines as they fill which can create a jarring, unpolished feel to the revealing text.

# Percent Visible
The "Godot" way to create a typing animation is in TypingLabelPercent.gd. Each update percent_visible is increased between 0.0 (no characters visible) to 1.0 (all characters visible). This allows for a more pleasing layout of the text and avoids text jumping between lines.

# Custom
TypingLabelCustom.gd was my original attempt as solving the jumping text but it doesn't really address the problem. However, it does allow for some interesting effects for stylised typing effects such as hacker-style *s or .s etc. It's left in as an interesting attempt. I don't recommend using it unless you want to decorate the animation effect with extra characters.

# Running
Load the project in Godot, press the Run button.

By default the Append mode is selected. To change mode, press one of the 3 mode buttons. If you change any settings for the Custom mode, press the Custom mode button again to update the settings.

Press Start to see the animation effect.

You can change the timer wait time using the spin box just above the Start button.
